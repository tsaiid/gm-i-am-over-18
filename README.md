A greasemonkey script to automatically hide the "I'm over 18" declaration.

## Features

-   Automatically clicks age verification buttons and bypasses age gates.
-   Supports a wide range of adult websites and content platforms.
-   **Improved Maintainability (v0.4.20251204)**: The script has been refactored with a configuration-based architecture, making it easier to add new sites or update existing rules.
-   **Enhanced Performance (v0.4.20251204)**: Utilizes `MutationObserver` for more efficient DOM monitoring, replacing the old `setInterval` polling method, leading to better performance and responsiveness.
